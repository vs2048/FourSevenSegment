This is an Arduino library to drive four seven segment LED displays using only three pins on the Arduino. The Arduino is connected to 28 shift registers which are connected in series. They could be on a single chip or multiple chips with connected in series with the clock pins tied together. After initialization, the setDisp(int) and clear() functions are used to set the display. The step() function must be called in the main loop of the Arduino to step the number into the shift register.
